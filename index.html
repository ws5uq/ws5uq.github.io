        <h4 class="subheader">Barnes in Her Context: How Djuna Barnes’ Text Was Received At Her Time of Publication</h4>
          <div class="text-muted">
            About this time (1920's) Barnes became part of the expatriate group which included Man Ray, Hemingway, Yeats, Gertrude Stein, and Mina Loy. Her striking beauty—auburn hair and angular features—along with her famous black cape, her haughty manner, and cruel, ‘wisecracking tongue’ (McAlmon, 34), made her a legendary character. She featured in almost every literary memoir of Paris at this time. She was also part of Natalie Clifford Barney’s lesbian circle - and as her public life diminished, Barnes’s status grew. Critical interest increased in the 1960s and 1970s, despite her attempts to block any inquiries (she ascribed her desire to protect her privacy to her 'English blood'). Increasingly cantankerous, she refused to allow critics to quote from her work, but her elegance and wit remained until the end.
No longer the 'most famous unknown in the world' (Kaever, 5), Barnes is now considered one of the most significant writers of the first half of the twentieth century.

        <p>“Djuna Barnes was indeed “a member of the circle that gravitated around the wealthy American expatriate Natalie Barney,” as Mr. Giroux puts it. He then goes on to mention Colette’s vivid depiction of this circle in her book “The Pure and Impure.” He does not mention, however, although one assumes he is aware of it, that Djuna Barnes’s “Ladies Almanack,” published anonymously in 1928, also concerns itself with this world of homosexual artists and the beau monde. It is a gentle satire on Barney’s coterie, in which Barney, in the guise of Dame Musset, the “Almanack’s” heroine, plays the main role. Thinly disguised characters such as Low-Heel, High-Head, Tilly Tweed-in-Blood and Lady Buck-and-Balk - immediately recognizable as Gertrude Stein, Alice Toklas, Radclyffe Hall and Una Troubridge - and other habitues of Barney’s Friday salon in various guises made the “Almanack” an immediate success. Although Djuna Barnes was soon recognized as its author, she did not officially admit it until a second edition came out in 1972, after Natalie Barney's death.”

        <p>“When Barnes’s first novel, Ryder, appeared in 1928, an acquaintance from her Greenwich Village days reviewed it in American Mercury  in words that describe both Barnes and her work:
‘Djuna Barnes has written a book that is all that she was, and must still be - vulgar, beautiful, defiant, witty, and a little mad - a bewildering hodge-podge of the obscene and virginal, of satire and wistfulness...a book that absolutely baffles classification, but that surely is the most amazing thing to come from a woman’s hand.’”

        <h4 class="subheader">Barnes Today: A “Glossing” of Tweets Indicative of How Ladies Almanack/Djuna Barnes Has Been Received More Recently</h4>
          <div class="text-muted">
            <p>General observations: The majority of tweets are from centers such as libraries or museums with a niche audience, not a lot of talk from everyday individuals. Barnes is almost exclusively tweeted about by openly supportive institutions or individual members of the LGBTQ community. The vast majority are supportive of Barnes’s work and share their praise enthusiastically.
            </p>
            <p>Example 1: On February 4, 2018, @SenateHouseLib tweeted: “Djuna Barnes’s Ladies Almanack 1928 is a satirical & affectionate portrait of the Parisian lesbian salon. Insistently bawdy, it nevertheless evaded legal censure by its indirect language. It’s on display in our #QBTC18 exhibition https://www.senatehouselibrary.ac.uk/  #LGBTHM18 ‘Women Writers.’”
</p>
            <p>Notes: Praise of Ladies Almanack as a satirical and affectionate representation via display in a museum exhibition.
Readers today seem to have a discernible respect for the brazenness with which Barnes shared her creative and “bawdy” social commentary.
            </p>
            <p>Example 2: On June 12, 2018, @HornbakeLibrary tweeted: “Happy birthday to artist and author #DjunaBarnes! Born #OTD in 1892, Barnes is best known for her groundbreaking modernist novel & early example of lesbian fiction, Nightwood.”
            </p>
            <p>Example 3: On June 3, 2015, @moteltampico tweeted: “#djunabarnes illustration from #LadiesAlmanack #reading #writing #literature #LGBTQ #queer”
            </p>
            <p>Notes: Further research into the bio of the user above reveals an open member in the LGBTQ community who speaks reverently about Djuna Barnes and her work.
There are also those who simply tweet some of her more common quotes about NYC and other things, those whose biographies lend little information about why they would care for Djuna Barnes and her body of work.
            </p>
            <p>Example 4: On June 13, 2013, @RCouriHayPR tweeted: “‘New York is the meeting place of the peoples, the only city where you can hardly find a typical American.’ #DjunaBarnes #ILoveNY”
            </p>
            <p>Notes:Nothing in this individual’s bio suggests membership in the LGBTQ membership, and further evidence of the same quote tweeted by other users suggests that the user has little knowledge of Barnes life and works. Reader category: poser tourist.
            </p>
            <p>Example 5: On August 21, 2016, @tom_sandercook tweeted: “This week my second years (trust me they do exist) & I have been diving into lesbian desire and modernism with Radclyffe Hall’s #TheWellOfLoneliness and Djuna Barnes’s #LadiesAlmanack. #TeacherTweets #HigherEducation #Literature pic.twitter.com/StSdRvIQd3”
            </p>
            <p>Notes: Tom is openly affiliated w/ LGBTQ support groups and works as a teacher.
