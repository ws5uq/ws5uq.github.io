          <div class="text-muted">
            About this time (1920's) Barnes became part of the expatriate group which included Man Ray, Hemingway, Yeats, Gertrude Stein, and Mina Loy. Her striking beauty—auburn hair and angular features—along with her famous black cape, her haughty manner, and cruel, ‘wisecracking tongue’ (McAlmon, 34), made her a legendary character. She featured in almost every literary memoir of Paris at this time. She was also part of Natalie Clifford Barney’s lesbian circle - and as her public life diminished, Barnes’s status grew. Critical interest increased in the 1960s and 1970s, despite her attempts to block any inquiries (she ascribed her desire to protect her privacy to her 'English blood'). Increasingly cantankerous, she refused to allow critics to quote from her work, but her elegance and wit remained until the end.
No longer the 'most famous unknown in the world' (Kaever, 5), Barnes is now considered one of the most significant writers of the first half of the twentieth century.

        <p>“Djuna Barnes was indeed “a member of the circle that gravitated around the wealthy American expatriate Natalie Barney,” as Mr. Giroux puts it. He then goes on to mention Colette’s vivid depiction of this circle in her book “The Pure and Impure.” He does not mention, however, although one assumes he is aware of it, that Djuna Barnes’s “Ladies Almanack,” published anonymously in 1928, also concerns itself with this world of homosexual artists and the beau monde. It is a gentle satire on Barney’s coterie, in which Barney, in the guise of Dame Musset, the “Almanack’s” heroine, plays the main role. Thinly disguised characters such as Low-Heel, High-Head, Tilly Tweed-in-Blood and Lady Buck-and-Balk - immediately recognizable as Gertrude Stein, Alice Toklas, Radclyffe Hall and Una Troubridge - and other habitues of Barney’s Friday salon in various guises made the “Almanack” an immediate success. Although Djuna Barnes was soon recognized as its author, she did not officially admit it until a second edition came out in 1972, after Natalie Barney's death.”

        <p>“When Barnes’s first novel, Ryder, appeared in 1928, an acquaintance from her Greenwich Village days reviewed it in American Mercury  in words that describe both Barnes and her work:
‘Djuna Barnes has written a book that is all that she was, and must still be - vulgar, beautiful, defiant, witty, and a little mad - a bewildering hodge-podge of the obscene and virginal, of satire and wistfulness...a book that absolutely baffles classification, but that surely is the most amazing thing to come from a woman’s hand.’”
